      <h1>The Psychology of Notifications</h1>
      <p>
            Welcome to the experiment <strong>"The Psychology of Notifications"</strong>.
            You’ll complete a series of simple yet mentally engaging tasks designed to measure focus,
            attention, and problem-solving under varying conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the experiment, you'll receive notifications at different intervals depending on the group you’re assigned to.
            These notifications may include distractions—or even helpful hints—but you won’t know which until you engage with them.
            The notifications will dissapear after 6 seconds of no interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your performance, speed, and interaction with notifications will be recorded for analysis.
            The entire experiment takes approximately <strong>15 minutes</strong> to complete.
          </p>

          <p className="warning">
            ⚠️ <strong>Once you choose your group below, the global experiment timer will begin.</strong><br />
            Make sure you're ready and free from interruptions.
